# Computing Performance Tests through Python

Here, I'm testing the performance of various coding techniques
through Python. My goal is to code a given algorithm using:
 - plain Python
 - Cython accelerated Python
 - Numba accelerated Python
 - Using a C/C++ library
 - Using a compiler optimized C/C++ library
 - Using a C/C++ library accelerated with inline assembly.

These tests are to expand my knowledge of Python performance testing
as well as Python code acceleration and C/C++ code acceleration
